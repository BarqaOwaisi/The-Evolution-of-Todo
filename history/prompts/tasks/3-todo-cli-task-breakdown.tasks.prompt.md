## Prompt

Tasks: Phase I — In-Memory Interactive Todo CLI

Version: v1.0
Status: Ready for implementation
Constitution: /sp.constitution
Specification: /sp.specify
Plan: /sp.plan

Objective:
Decompose the approved plan into small, atomic, verifiable tasks that can be executed sequentially by Claude Code to generate a fully functional interactive Todo CLI application.

---

Phase 0 — Project Initialization

T0.1 Create project structure
- Generate `/src` directory and subpackages as defined in /sp.plan
- Add `__init__.py` files where required
- Create placeholder modules with no logic

T0.2 Define configuration constants
- Create `config.py`
- Define:
  - Menu option mappings
  - Exit keywords
  - Status indicators
  - Authentication retry limits (if any)

---

Phase 1 — Data Models & Repositories

T1.1 Implement Task model
- Create Task data structure
- Fields: id, title, description, completed
- Ensure defaults and readability

T1.2 Implement in-memory Task repository
- Store tasks in a list or dictionary
- Provide methods:
  - add_task
  - get_all_tasks
  - get_task_by_id
  - update_task
  - delete_task
  - toggle_task_status

---

Phase 2 — Authentication System

T2.1 Define in-memory user store
- Create a simple user model
- Hardcode at least one valid user
- Store credentials in memory only

T2.2 Implement authenticator
- Prompt for user name and password
- Validate credentials
- Loop until valid input is provided
- Return authenticated user object

---

Phase 3 — CLI Interaction Components

T3.1 Implement greetings module
- Define a list of greeting templates
- Randomly select greeting per session
- Support user name interpolation

T3.2 Implement prompt utilities
- Centralize all user-facing text
- Ensure clarity and friendly tone
- Standardize error messages

T3.3 Implement menu rendering
- Display numbered menu options
- Ensure consistent formatting
- Redisplay menu after each action

---

Phase 4 — Intent Parsing

T4.1 Implement input normalization
- Trim whitespace
- Convert to lowercase
- Safely handle empty input

T4.2 Implement intent parser
- Map numeric inputs to actions
- Map keyword-based inputs to actions
- Handle exit intents explicitly
- Return structured intent result

---

Phase 5 — Task Service Layer

T5.1 Implement add task flow
- Prompt for title and description
- Validate title presence
- Call repository add method
- Display confirmation

T5.2 Implement view tasks flow
- Retrieve all tasks
- Format output with status indicators
- Handle empty task list

T5.3 Implement update task flow
- Prompt for task ID
- Validate existence
- Prompt for new values
- Apply updates

T5.4 Implement delete task flow
- Prompt for task ID
- Confirm deletion
- Remove task from repository

T5.5 Implement toggle completion flow
- Prompt for task ID
- Toggle completed state
- Display updated status

---

Phase 6 — Application Control Loop

T6.1 Implement main event loop
- Display menu
- Capture user input
- Resolve intent
- Dispatch to appropriate service
- Loop until exit intent

T6.2 Implement exit flow
- Display personalized goodbye message
- Terminate application cleanly

---

Phase 7 — Error Handling & Validation

T7.1 Input validation
- Guard against invalid task IDs
- Handle non-numeric ID input
- Prevent crashes from bad input

T7.2 Friendly error recovery
- Display helpful error messages
- Always return to menu after error

---

Phase 8 — Integration & Final Assembly

T8.1 Wire modules in main.py
- Initialize repositories
- Run authentication flow
- Start main event loop

T8.2 Smoke test interactive flows
- Login
- Add, view, update, delete tasks
- Toggle completion
- Exit cleanly

---

Acceptance Checklist

- All tasks executable by Claude Code without manual edits
- All five core features fully functional
- Menu-based interaction only
- Natural language and numeric inputs supported
- In-memory state only
- Fully compliant with constitution and specification

---

End of Tasks

## Response snapshot

Task breakdown for Phase I In-Memory Interactive Todo CLI has been created. The tasks are decomposed into 8 phases covering project initialization, data models, authentication, CLI components, intent parsing, task service, control loop, error handling, and integration.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive task breakdown for the Todo CLI application
- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable at task stage
- 📁 Files: Created task file at specs/todo-cli/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implementation of individual tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The task breakdown is atomic and ready for implementation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Not applicable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Not applicable
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin task implementation
